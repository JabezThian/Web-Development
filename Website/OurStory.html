          <h2>Founder of Golden Cafe</h2>
          <span class="position">John Smith Williams</span>
          <p>I am John Smith Williams from the United States of America. I was born with the ambition to open my very own Cafe. I studied about business in Singapore when I was 17 years old and fell in love with Singapore. I was fortunate to have a best friend (James Gorden) in Singapore who was pursing his dream to be a chef. That was when I decided to open a Cafe in Singapore with him.</p>
